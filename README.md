# Hey ! This is our work on this UX-UI week !
@Elyesv @LouisPerre @Adelktr

We had to realize a full autimatic mailing system for the next year's new student's hiring campaign.
This work has been discomposed in 3 main steps :

## 1 : Wireframing and modeling

This first part was mostly dedicated to wireframe the emails and the landing page and then realize the models based on the wireframes.


## 2 : Coding

We learnt how to code in ``.mjml``, the main language used for creating mail.
Thus we were able to create and code the models previousy modeled.
Appart from that we also coded the landing page in ``scss``, ``javascript`` and ``html``.



## 3 : Deploying and setting up the trackers

This last part was probably the longest to realize because we encountered many problems such as creating account with the informations that the user put in the form's fields,
but we finally succeeded to deploy it successfully with a complete opperationnal mailing system.
